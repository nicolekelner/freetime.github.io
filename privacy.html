                     <li>Right to access your personal data</li>
                     <li>Right to erasure ("right to be forgotten")</li>
                     <li>Right to data portability</li>
                     <li>Right to object to processing</li>
                 </ul>
                 <p>To exercise these rights, contact us through the App's support feature.</p>

                 <h3>Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR Article 6)</h3>
                 <p>We process your personal data under the following legal bases:</p>
                 <ul>
                     <li><strong>Contract Performance</strong> (Art. 6(1)(b)): Account creation, authentication, subscription management, and core app functionality (app blocking, puzzles, focus sessions). These are necessary to provide the service you signed up for.</li>
                     <li><strong>Consent</strong> (Art. 6(1)(a)): Usage analytics (Mixpanel) and advertising attribution (AppsFlyer). You can withdraw consent at any time through Settings &gt; Other &gt; Analytics toggle, and the app will continue to function normally.</li>
                     <li><strong>Legitimate Interest</strong> (Art. 6(1)(f)): Crash reporting (Firebase Crashlytics) to maintain app stability and security. We have balanced this against your privacy rights and determined the minimal, anonymized nature of crash data justifies this basis.</li>
                 </ul>

                 <h3>International Data Transfers</h3>
                 <p>Your data may be transferred to and processed in the United States by our service providers:</p>
                 <ul>
                     <li><strong>Firebase/Google</strong> (USA) — Protected under Google's Data Processing Terms and Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)</li>
                     <li><strong>Mixpanel</strong> (USA) — Protected under Mixpanel's Data Processing Addendum and Standard Contractual Clauses</li>
                     <li><strong>RevenueCat</strong> (USA) — Protected under RevenueCat's Data Processing Agreement and Standard Contractual Clauses</li>
                     <li><strong>AppsFlyer</strong> (USA) — Protected under AppsFlyer's Data Processing Agreement and Standard Contractual Clauses</li>
                 </ul>
                 <p>These transfers are safeguarded by EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) as approved by the European Commission, and where applicable, the EU-US Data Privacy Framework.</p>

                 <h3>Withdrawing Consent</h3>
                 <p>Where we process your data based on consent, you can withdraw consent at any time:</p>
                 <ul>
                     <li><strong>Analytics</strong>: Settings &gt; Other &gt; Analytics toggle</li>
                     <li><strong>Ad Tracking</strong>: iOS Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Tracking</li>
                 </ul>
                 <p>Withdrawing consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing performed before withdrawal. The app will continue to function normally without analytics.</p>

                 <h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint</h3>
                 <p>If you are in the EU/EEA, you have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection supervisory authority if you believe your data has been processed unlawfully. A list of EU data protection authorities can be found at: <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en">https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en</a></p>
