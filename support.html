                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>After downloading Free Time from the App Store:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Open the app and tap "Get Started"</li>
                            <li>Grant Screen Time permissions when prompted - this is required for the app to work</li>
                            <li>Select the apps you want to block from the app picker</li>
                            <li>Choose your puzzle difficulty and preferences</li>
                            <li>Set up your blocking schedule (optional)</li>
                        </ol>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Why does Free Time need Screen Time permissions?</summary>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Free Time uses Apple's Screen Time API to block apps on your device. This is the official, secure way to manage app access on iOS. Without Screen Time permissions, the app cannot block or monitor your selected apps.</p>
                        <p>Your data stays private and on your device - we never collect or share your Screen Time information.</p>
                    </div>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What iOS version do I need?</summary>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Free Time requires iOS 16.0 or later. The app uses Screen Time API features that are only available on recent iOS versions.</p>

                <h3>App Blocking & Puzzles</h3>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>How does app blocking work?</summary>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Free Time uses Apple's Screen Time framework to block apps you've selected. When you try to open a blocked app, you'll see a blocking screen that requires you to complete a puzzle or mindfulness activity to unlock it temporarily.</p>
                        <p>This creates a mindful pause between the impulse to open an app and actually using it, helping you be more intentional with your phone time.</p>

                    <summary>What types of puzzles are available?</summary>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Free Time offers several puzzle types:</p>

                            <li><strong>Gratitude Journal:</strong> Write something you're grateful for to shift your mindset</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You can choose your preferred puzzle types and difficulty levels in the app settings.</p>

                    <summary>Can I customize puzzle difficulty?</summary>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Yes! Free Time offers multiple difficulty levels:</p>

                    <summary>How long do apps stay unlocked after solving a puzzle?</summary>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>You can configure the unlock duration in your app settings. Options typically range from 5 minutes to several hours. After this time expires, the apps will be blocked again and require another puzzle to unlock.</p>

                        <p>Yes! Free Time supports app groups, allowing you to organize apps into categories (like Social Media, Games, etc.) and apply different blocking schedules and unlock requirements to each group.</p>

                    <summary>Can I have apps blocked all the time?</summary>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Yes! You can set up an "always-on" schedule by selecting all days of the week and setting a 24-hour time range (like 12:00 AM to 11:59 PM). Apps will remain blocked and require puzzle solving whenever you try to access them.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Instant Focus is a quick way to block apps immediately without waiting for a scheduled time.
